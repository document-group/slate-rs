## Why did you fork?

I'm going to be stuck on these versions

```sh
 - slate-base64-serializer@0.2.112
 - slate-html-serializer@0.8.11
 - slate-hyperscript@0.13.9
 - slate-plain-serializer@0.7.11
 - slate-prop-types@0.5.42
 - slate-react-placeholder@0.2.9
 - slate-react@0.22.10
 - slate@0.47.9
```

And I can't afford to have the rug pulled out on me.
